Hamilton is the theme that powers my personal blog. It is based on the [Components](http://components.underscores.me/) starter theme generator.

As I'm moving into web development as a career, I thought I should take a look at my site, and the previous theme was looking a bit...janky. There was a front page on there that I no longer wanted, it was using the Foundation framework, and I felt like it could be stripped back a bit. With something so minimal I felt that I'd be better off just writing the media queries myself, so I started again from scratch.
